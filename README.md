# Code Analyzer Project

## Overview

The **Code Analyzer** is a full-stack project that includes both a backend and frontend. It analyzes the code provided by users and generates insights. The backend is built using Spring Boot, and the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Backend

The backend is built using **Spring Boot**, and it exposes an API for code analysis. The core of the backend is implemented in **Java** and leverages libraries such as **Spring MVC** and **Maven**.

### Features:
- Code analysis and error detection.
- RESTful API to interact with the frontend.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan735/Code-Analyzer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Ai-Code-Analyzer-Backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd Ai-Code-Analyzer-Backend
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The backend will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Frontend

The frontend is a simple UI built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that interacts with the backend API to display code analysis results.

### Features:
- User interface to input code for analysis.
- Displays results of the analysis received from the backend.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `CodeAnalyzer-frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd CodeAnalyzer-frontend
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

The frontend will be available locally once the HTML file is opened.
